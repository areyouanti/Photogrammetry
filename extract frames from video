ffmpeg command line code
check if ffmpeg is working in cmd with: > ffmpeg
make sure to change your directory to a new folder titled after your project, for this purpose my folder was called "cdog"
My cmd looks like: 

C:\Users\me\Desktop\cdog>

the video file i am extracting from is in "cdog" and is named, "claramotiontrack.m4v"

After running the following line in cmd, each image saves and renames itself in numerical order within "cdog"

=========

ffmpeg -i claramotiontrack.m4v -r 1/1 cdog%0d.png

======

ffmpeg -i file.mpg -r 1/1 $filename%03d.jpg

# for longer videos this conversion will take longer, it is recommended that you use .png for image saves because it is lossless
